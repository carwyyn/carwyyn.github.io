    ,html: '<p> <strong>Wales\' best universities are struggling to recruit students from disadvantaged backgrounds, figures reveal.</strong><br><br> Recruitment to Welsh Universities from Wales\' poorest households vary dramatically between institutions, with some struggling to meet the benchmarks expected for recruiting those from disadvantaged backgrounds.<br><br> Community support to higher education programmes have also been cut by up to a quarter since 2011, and the student finance changes brought by the Diamond Review will not have a "transformative effect" on these patterns of entry. <br><br>Some universities in Wales struggle to reach the benchmarks expected of recruitment from students from state schools, NS-NEC classes 4-7, as well as those from low participation areas. New figures revealed by a Freedom of Information request to the Student Loans Company show the scale of the disparity. <br><br>Whilst these numbers do not include every student who attend university, they give us an idea of the trends of disparity between institutions in recruiting Welsh domiciled students from a low-income background.</p>'

In comparison, the University of South Wales\' comparative figure is 37 percent, and 57 percent at Glyndwr Wrexham University.<br><br>The Higher Education Statistics Agency(HESA) also back these trends, showing some universities lacking behind the Welsh national proportion of students from low participation backgrounds attending university, and even failing to reach the benchmark expected whilst including other factors, such as entry tariffs.</p>'

The Diamond Review is hailed for making maintenance a priority, providing £8,100, and finance therefore would not discourage students from applying. However, students from households earning less than £20,000 can currently benefit from grant and maintenance support in excess of the amount proposed under Diamond, meaning any changes the Welsh Government might commit to could leave students worse off. <br><br>This is however dependent on how much of the Diamond Review the Welsh Government will implement, it has only accepted the principle of the changes to maintenance support so far.<br> <br>Dr Maria Hinfelaar urged, "we would hope that once the Diamond Review is implemented by the students loans company and the fees will be coming in, there will be better resources all around including to initiatives such as [reaching wider]". </p>'
